## Overview

These pages go over how to read/write JSON files from within MATLAB.

## Dependencies

In the Campbell Muscle Lab, we use the JSONLab toolbox to read/write JSON files in MATLAB. This can be acquired through the MATLAB Add-on Manager. See [this link](https://campbell-muscle-lab.github.io/MATMyoSim/pages/installation/installation.html#how-to-install-dependencies) for an example of getting a toolbox from this Add-on Manager.

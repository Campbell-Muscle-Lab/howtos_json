## Overview

This page covers some of the ways the members of the Campbell Muscle Lab interact with JSON files on a daily basis.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an easy to use open source text editor/[IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, file previews, and much more.

Visual Studio code is great for editing JSON files because of the automatic error highlighting, formatting, and the ability to modify JSON files right alongside the code used for your model. Below is a screenshot of an example JSON file in Visual Studio Code:

### Example of Error Highlighting

Following is an example of how Visual Studio Code highlights errors in JSON files. In this particular case, we have forgotten the exponent for the `"max_rate"` parameter:
